About FakeCamLib
================
You can use the fake camera PRC to test the camera library of the Zire 71 on
the NTSimulator. 

The fake camera PRC generates random colors and is updated every second. It
will work only on the Zire 71 simulator.

Instructions
============
1. In your Zire 71 simulator directory, create a folder named "Autoload".
2. Copy FakeCamLibCW.prc into Autoload.
3. Start the Zire 71 simulator.
4. Perform a soft reset in the simulator.  The fake camera library will not work until you perform this soft reset.
5. Use CTRL+V to open the camera slider; CTRL+W to close the slider; and CTRL+X to press the shutter button.
